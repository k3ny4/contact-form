questions:
1. how make labels above input textboxes?
2. how make these labels thicker and change color, if they're not in separate class?
3. how to check if there is a "@" symbol in Email address and .com used or another domain that can be used for email.
4. how to make template go to "+38(0..)-XXX-XXXX" (where is X - you need to type your number, and also where is (0..) - you need to type cell operator code) after click on "Number" textbox, like if there is an error in typing number, e.g. "+38(020) - wrong number". It should accept only Ukrainian operator codes, such as (066);(050);(097) etc.
