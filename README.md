questions:
1. how make labels above input textboxes?
2. how make these labels thicker and change color, if they're not in separate class?
3. how to check if there is a "@" symbol in Email address and use template "+38(0..)-XXX-XXXX" after click on "Number" textbox, and also check if there is an error in typing number, like "+38(020) - wrong number". It should accept only Ukrainian operator codes, such as (066);(050);(097) etc.
